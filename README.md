# RPG WIP
## clone, run npm install:
### start webpack-dev-server: yarn start (or npm start)

Currently there is no UI, so you kind of have to know what the keys do.
Ill give you some hints:
1: Toggle auto attack.
2: charge (run at target and stun them for 3 seconds)
3: rend (apply a dot that does 15 dmg per tick)
4: strike (next melee swing does 11 extra damage)
5: shout (raises attack power by 25)
6: thunder clap (does 10 damage and slows enemy attacks by 100%)
7: hamstring (does 7 dmg and causes target to run half as fast)

Probably sounds familiar...

However, check it out and let me know if you have any questions.

The game is very early in development, though there is a large framework in place that will enable tons of options.

Here is some documentation for the Combat System if you have questions:
